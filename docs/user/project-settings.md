# Settings and project overrides

On web and desktop, the "Applying settings for …" sentence at the top of Settings pages picks
the project and environment a change applies to. Pages that only hold device preferences, such as
Appearance, don't show it. They start at **All projects** and **All environments**
and stay selected as you move between categories or search for a setting.

Preferences saved on this device, such as appearance, confirmations and browser profiles, always
show and ignore the selection. Everything else is stored on a server. Choose one environment to
edit its settings, or leave **All environments** to edit every connected environment at once.
Offline environments keep their current values; this is a bulk edit, not a synced global default.

Choose a project to override settings for it on the selected environments. A layers icon beside
each server row's title shows where the value comes from: the built-in default, the environment,
or a project override. Click it to see that chain on every selected environment. An override can
be reset to inherit again. Settings that cannot be overridden by a project are shown read-only
while a project is selected.

When the selected environments disagree, the control shows **Mixed** in place of a value and the
layers icon turns amber. Picking a value applies it to every selected environment.

Changing an environment value never touches a project's own override. When projects override the
setting you are editing, the layers icon counts them and the chain lists each one with its value:
click a project to jump to it, or **Reset all** to make those projects follow the environment
again.

Providers and diagnostics are per machine: they show one environment at a time, the primary
one until you pick another. Every other setting fans out to the selection.

With a project selected, a provider's switch in **Settings → Providers** turns it on or off for
that project only, in either direction: a provider off on the machine can be used in one project,
and one on everywhere can be kept out of another. That project's model pickers follow the switch,
and no new turn there can start on a provider it turned off, including queued messages and
follow-ups from delegated tasks. A turn already running when the switch flips finishes. A delegated
task's result still lands in its parent thread, which sees it on its next turn. Reset returns the project to the
machine's setting. Every other provider setting stays per machine.

On mobile, open **Settings** and use the filter in its header to choose connected environments
and a project. The filter stays available in server-setting pages. With **All projects** selected,
the server-setting pages, such as Threads, edit the selected
environments' defaults. Choosing a project edits its overrides on the selected
environments. Use **Use defaults** in a page to remove that page's project overrides.
Open **Settings → Projects** to rename the project across its selected
connected checkouts and see where those checkouts live.
Settings that are environment-wide stay read-only while a project is selected. When selected
targets disagree, a control shows **Mixed** until you choose one value. Appearance, keyboard,
and other phone-only settings ignore the filter.

## Pin and archive projects

Pinned projects come first in the project pickers: the project picker on a new thread, the
new-thread list, the command palette, and the sidebar project filter. Pin or unpin a project from
its row in any of those lists, or press the thread pin shortcut (`mod+shift+p` by default) on the highlighted row. **Pin
project** in the command palette and **Settings → Projects** work too. A list keeps its order
while it is open, so a new pin moves up the next time you open it.

Archive a project you are done with in **Settings → Projects**. It leaves the project pickers.
Its threads, settings, and files stay as they are, and archived projects still show in the
Settings project list, marked **Archived**. Choose one there and select **Unarchive** to bring it
back. On mobile, both are in **Settings → Projects → Organize**.

A project on several machines must have every machine connected to pin or archive it.

## Defaults and inheritance

Threads contains the model for new threads. Browser controls agent browser
access. The same rows edit environment defaults or project overrides depending on the
project crumb.

The Projects category, under Code, holds the project's name, icon, actions,
checkouts and removal. Actions belong to a project: editing them creates the project's own list
on each selected environment, and reset returns to the environment's shared list. A project's
`t3.json` actions can be imported there.

A project override wins over the environment setting, which wins over the built-in default.
Browser access changes apply when an agent session next starts.

## Project icons

Select the project and open Project to choose an icon, emoji, monogram, or image. The choice applies to
every checkout in the project group and appears on connected clients. Choose **Automatic** to let
aprende detect an icon again.

Choose **Monogram** in the icon picker to set one or two letters or numbers and a color.

When no image is found, web and desktop show a two-character monogram with a color
from the icon palette, derived from the saved project name. For example, `Nebula` becomes `NA`,
`Silver Orchard` becomes `SO`, and `M7 Forge` becomes `M7`.
