# aprende

aprende is an open-source desktop app for learning difficult things. A tutor finds where the learner's understanding ends, plans a path to their goal as a dependency map, and teaches one reasoning step at a time: predict, explain, check, repair. Learning sessions persist into a knowledge graph that later sessions build on.

aprende is a hard fork of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) (MIT, by T3 Tools Inc.), and is not affiliated with T3 Tools Inc. It keeps T3 Code's runtime: a Node WebSocket server that runs the learner's own `claude` (Claude Code) or `codex` (Codex CLI) as subprocesses, an event-sourced orchestrator, an Electron shell and a React web client. The tutor talks to the app through aprende's own MCP server. Upstream fixes are ported by hand from the `upstream` remote. Credit T3 Code by name and link only: no T3 logos, icons, branding or endpoints.

## What we never compromise on

1. **The learner's own login.** aprende runs the CLI the learner installed, with their login. It never asks for, stores or proxies API keys or account credentials, and never offers its own claude.ai sign-in.
2. **Local and open.** Learning data stays on the learner's machine. Everything is MIT and built in the open.
3. **Teaching quality over features.** Every tutor-facing change (the tutor prompt, MCP tool descriptions) changes how people learn. Treat model-facing text like code and test it.
4. **Performance.** Learners sit in long sessions. No continuously repainting animations, no oversized WebSocket payloads, lists that render fast.

## How to work here

Prefer simple systems and software that feels obvious. Do not preserve complexity just because it already exists; much of the inherited coding-agent machinery is on its way out. Do not introduce machinery because it looks impressive. Channel both "measure twice, cut once" and "yagni".

Think of these instructions as good defaults. The developer's preferences override anything here.

## A small glossary

- **you** means the agent reading this file and changing aprende.
- **learner** means the person using aprende to learn.
- **tutor** means the model, run through a provider, that teaches inside a session.
- **provider** means the CLI aprende runs for the tutor: Claude Code or Codex.
- **client** means the web or desktop UI.
- **environment** means one running aprende server and the machine, files, provider credentials and state it owns.
- **project** means an environment-local workspace rooted at a folder. The learner's materials for a subject live there.
- **notebook** means a project as the learner sees it: an outline of topics they own, with lesson threads linked to topics. The tutor only proposes outline changes; the learner accepts them.
- **thread** means one learning session: the conversation and its learning record.
- **turn** means one learner-to-tutor cycle.
- **learning record** means a thread's questions, answers, assessment and plan, stored by `apps/server/src/learning/LearningService.ts`.
- **aprende home** means the base data directory, `~/.aprende` by default. Runtime state lives below its `userdata` directory.

## The three ways to hurt yourself

1. **Killing by pattern.** Never `pkill -f`, `pgrep | kill`, or `kill` a PID you found by matching a name, path, or worktree string. Your own agent process has this worktree's path in its argv, and this machine runs several other dev servers at once. Kill only a PID you captured at spawn, or the owner of your port from `ss -H -ltnp` after confirming `/proc/<pid>/cwd` is your worktree.
2. **Writing to the live install.** `~/.aprende/userdata` is the developer's real aprende database, in use while you work. Reading it and copying from it are fine, and a good way to get real test data (see Test data). Never start a server against it, never open it read-write, never clean it up.
3. **Baking in origins.** Never set `VITE_HTTP_URL` or `VITE_WS_URL` for dev. Dev is single-origin and Vite proxies `/api`, `/ws`, `/oauth`, and `/.well-known`. Setting them bakes localhost into the bundle and silently breaks every remote browser.

## Hit every surface

The most common defect in this repo is a change that works on the path you tested and is missing everywhere else. Before calling frontend work done, walk this list and say which entries applied:

- **Entry points.** A behavior reachable from the chat view is usually also reachable from Settings, the command palette, and a keybinding. Fixing one is not fixing the feature.
- **Clients.** Web and desktop (wraps web, adds Electron shell/IPC). Shared logic lives in `packages/client-runtime`.
- **Providers.** Claude and Codex each have an adapter. Tutor-shaped features need a decision for both: Claude gets the tutor prompt as its system prompt, Codex as developer instructions.
- **Tutor.** A capability the learner can trigger is usually one the tutor should reach through the `learn` MCP toolkit. That only works when it is a service method, not handler code.
- **Contracts.** Anything crossing the wire is typed in `packages/contracts`. Change the schema and the server, web, and desktop all follow.
- **Reverse states.** If you added a way in, add the way out and the way to see it. Snooze needs unsnooze. Close needs reopen. A one-way door is a bug.
- **Docs.** Check whether the change makes existing guidance inaccurate. Apply the [documentation rules](#documentation) before adding anything.

## Dev servers

- `vp i` installs. Worktrees get this from the t3.json setup script; if module resolution looks broken, it probably did not run.
- Setup runs in the background. While `.aprende/setup-running` names a live PID, wait for it and do not run `vp i`. It ends with `.aprende/setup-done` or `.aprende/setup-failed` (with the error tail). With no marker at all, setup never ran here, so run `vp i` yourself.
- `vp run dev` starts server and web. In a worktree, state defaults to that worktree's gitignored `.aprende`, which deliberately outranks an ambient `APRENDE_HOME` so you cannot land on shared state by accident. An explicit `--home-dir` still wins.
- Ports derive from the worktree path and are stable across restarts, but read the real ones from the `[dev-runner]` line since occupied ports shift.
- Sharing over the tailnet is three steps: run `vp run dev --share` in the background, wait for the `pairingUrl:` line in its output, then give that full URL to an unpaired browser. Do not wire up `tailscale serve` by hand, open the URL yourself, or consume the user's pairing link. A browser with the reusable dev cookie can use the bare origin. If a normal one-time token was consumed, mint a fresh one with `node apps/server/src/bin.ts pair`. It carries standard scopes, while the startup URL carries admin scopes.
- To reuse web dev auth across worktrees, configure one fixed `APRENDE_DEV_AUTH_TOKEN` in the main checkout's gitignored `.env`. The `t3.json` setup links that file into worktrees. Never commit or publish the token or a startup URL. See [Reusable dev credential](docs/operations/development.md#reusable-dev-credential).
- Stop what you started, by the PID you tracked. See rule 1.
- Need a second checkout? `git worktree add` it next to this worktree, not in `/tmp`. Remove it when done.

## Test data

An empty database is a bad test. Seed your worktree's `.aprende` with a copy of real data instead of pointing at live state:

- The first `vp run dev` in a worktree does this for you when its database is missing and the source is at most 500 MiB. Larger sources warn and dev starts with an empty database. `--no-seed` or `APRENDE_DEV_SEED=0` skips seeding. Manual migration still accepts larger sources and may use substantial disk space before pruning.
- Run `vp run migrate-dev-db` with your dev server stopped to refresh. It rebuilds `<worktree>/.aprende/userdata/statev2.sqlite` from a read-only snapshot of `~/.aprende/userdata/statev2.sqlite`, the developer's real data. It keeps recent projects and their stopped threads, and drops pending work, auth sessions, and links to other environments, so your dev server never runs the developer's agents or reaches their other machines. Raise `--projects` and `--threads-per-project` for more data.
- Refresh `statev2.sqlite`, not `state.sqlite`. The server copies the V1 `state.sqlite` only when `statev2.sqlite` is missing.
- Bring `secrets` and `settings.json` only if the flow under test needs them.
- Copy in, never symlink. Data flows one way: into your sandbox, never back out.

## Verifying

- Before you push, run `vp run check:changed`. It runs CI's fast checks for changed files: format, lint, knip, typecheck of affected packages and dependents, tests beside changes, and the cross-file checks those miss. CI still runs the full test suites.
- While you iterate, run `vp test run <files>`. For big files, add `-t "<name>"`.
- Use `vp run typecheck`; it caches per package. Each package runs `effect-tsgo tsrs --noEmit`, the Rust TypeScript 7 checker with Effect's diagnostics built in. There is no `typescript` package to run.
- Run `node -e` snippets from `apps/server` or the owning package. `effect` does not resolve from the repo root.
- Test behavior that can break, such as orchestration and event-sourcing, provider protocol translation, auth and permission guards, persistence and migrations, external-format parsing, race fixes, and the logic a bug fix changed. Leave out tests for what types already guarantee, trivial logic, copy text, smoke runs, mock-call mirrors, callback wiring, and props rendered to static markup.
- Extend before you add. When an existing test or table covers the behavior, add a row or an assertion there. Write a new `it` only when no case fits.
- Test at one layer: the lowest one that fails on `main`. Do not repeat the case in a wrapper test, at each call site, or in web and mobile copies of the same logic.
- [Testing](docs/internals/testing.md) carries these same test rules, plus review guidance, for review bots. Change both together.
- **Do not run repo-wide checks.** No `vp check`, no `vp run -r test`, no `vp run -r typecheck` unless I ask. CI owns the full suite.
- Backend behavior changes ship with focused tests for that behavior.
- Proof for a bug fix depends on the bug. Logic, data, state, and protocol bugs get a failing test first (the fewest that fail on `main` for that reason, in an existing case of the module's test file where one fits), then the fix. Purely visual bugs (spacing, colour, alignment, a layout shift) get before/after captures as their proof and no test: do not add UI tests for nitpicks, and do not ask for one in review when a capture already shows it. A server-only fix with no visible surface ships the test plus a short runtime transcript.
- The server is event-sourced, and side effects run after the command commits. In tests, drain the effect worker (`OrchestrationEffectWorkerV2.drain`) or await the specific persisted event or `Deferred` that marks the milestone. Never wait on sleeps or polling. A test that needs a timeout to pass is wrong. Concretely:
  - `it.effect` runs on a `TestClock`; `Effect.sleep` only advances through `TestClock.adjust`. `it.live` is wall-clock and only for subprocess or network fixtures.
  - No `yieldNow` or `sleep` polling loops. Await the `Deferred`, take from the `Queue`, or drain the worker.
  - No per-test timeout argument or `retry`. The project timeout is the ceiling, and flaky tests are fixed, not retried.
  - No `performance.now()` or `Date.now()` deltas. Assert on events and counts, not elapsed time.
  - Browser tests assert through `expect.element` or `vi.waitFor`, never `requestAnimationFrame` or `transitionend`.
  - `vi.mock` factories must not spread a real module that pulls in Shiki or the diff workers.
  - `it.skip` and friends need a tracking issue on the line above: `// quarantine: #1234 <why>`.
  - Lint enforces this: `aprende/no-test-timeout-or-unreasoned-skip`, `aprende/no-frame-waits-in-browser-tests`, `aprende/no-wall-clock-in-tests`, `aprende/no-real-time-wait-in-tests`, `aprende/no-polling-loop-in-tests`.
- Web browser tests are `*.browser.test.tsx` or `*.browser.test.ts` and render with `await using screen = await render(...)` from `apps/web/test/render.tsx`. `aprende/require-disposable-render` errors on the old patterns.
  - Acquire what the test drives after mounting (fake timers it advances, spies it sets up after mounting) after the render, so it disposes before the unmount. Anything the first render reads comes before it.
  - A helper that renders and then waits or clicks puts the screen in an `AsyncDisposableStack` and `move()`s it out only on success, so a failed wait still unmounts.
  - `rerender` needs a fresh element on every call.
  - No lifecycle hooks and no module-level mutable state. Shared mock state that `vi.mock` factories read is reset by a `setup()` call at the top of the test.
  - `router` is on by default. Pass `router: false` only with a one-line comment saying why.

  ```tsx
  it("saves on Enter", async () => {
    const onSave = vi.fn();
    using _now = vi.spyOn(Date, "now").mockReturnValue(0);
    await using screen = await render(<TitleEditor onSave={onSave} />, { router: "/threads/1" });
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByRole("textbox"), "Title{Enter}");
    expect(onSave).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Title");
  });
  ```

- User-visible frontend changes should get one integrated pass in a real client with `test-app`. The primary agent does this once after integrating. Subagents do not launch their own dev servers.

- Real tutor turns cost money. To watch a turn stream through the pipeline and UI, use the free `Replay (dev)` provider that `vp run dev` registers; [test-app](.agents/skills/test-app/SKILL.md) shows how to start one. Replays do not call the `learn` tools, so learning cards need a real provider: use its cheapest model, such as Haiku for Claude.

## Evals

`evals/` checks how real models behave with aprende's model-facing text: agent instructions, MCP tool descriptions and schemas, and generated titles. Before you change that text, read [evals/README.md](evals/README.md) and run the evals it names. When you fix a model behavior bug, add a case that fails before the fix.

## Pull requests

- Never make a PR unless the developer explicitly asks you to do so.
- Merging to `main` deploys: the maintainer's Mac builds and installs every new `main` commit as their desktop app ([Desktop auto-deploy](docs/operations/desktop-autodeploy.md)). Merge only what builds and runs.
- Conventional commit titles, plain language: `fix(web): new threads no longer spike CPU`.
- Body: the problem in a sentence or two, then how you fixed it. End with the model and harness that did the work.
- UI changes need before/after images. Motion or timing needs a short video.
- Upload PR evidence to GitHub. Never commit PR-only screenshots or assets such as `.github/pr-assets/`.
- One request is one PR. Split it only when the maintainer asks.
- When babysitting: call `watch_pull_request` and end your turn. aprende wakes you on checks, comments, or conflicts. Do not poll or sleep. Verify each bot finding against the source, fix real ones, dismiss false positives with a written reason. Stay quiet when nothing is new. Stop when the bots are green on the latest commit.

## Documentation

Most code changes do not need an internal documentation change. Agents can read the code.

- `docs/internals/` is for architectural decisions and their reasons, constraints that span components, and implementation traps that are hard to discover from the source. Before adding a paragraph, ask what a maintainer would get wrong without it. If reading the relevant code answers the question, leave it out.
- Do not document every feature, enumerate fields or methods, narrate control flow, maintain file catalogs, or append PR summaries. Types, tests, and code already record the implementation. The glossary defines shared vocabulary; it is not a feature index.
- A local reason the code can't show goes in a short nearby code comment. Use an internal doc when the reasoning crosses boundaries or needs context the code cannot carry well. Link to the relevant source instead of copying it.
- When a documented decision or constraint changes, rewrite or remove the affected text. Do not append another account of the new behavior. A new internal page needs a distinct, durable reason to exist.
- `docs/user/` helps users accomplish tasks. Give each major feature a concise section explaining what it does, how to start, and anything unintuitive. A settings path is useful; descriptions of visible buttons, icons, layouts, animations, or every UI state are not. Before adding text, ask what task or decision it helps the user with.
- Keep user docs in the shipped product's voice, without implementation details or contributor tooling. Update the relevant feature section when how to use it changes. A UI tweak does not need a documentation entry, and a new control does not need its own page.
- `docs/operations/` holds maintainer setup, release, and debugging procedures. Keep instructions for operating an installed aprende server in the user guides.

## Plans and work artifacts

- Do not commit implementation plans, research notes, or agent scratch files. Keep temporary working material outside the worktree. `.plans/` is gitignored only as a safety net for legacy tooling.
- Track active work in the GitHub issue that owns it.
- A merged PR is the implementation record. Close or update its tracking item when the work lands; do not preserve a second checklist in the repository.

## How it works

Clients send typed WebSocket requests. The server turns them into _commands_. The _orchestrator_ (`apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/Orchestrator.ts`) serializes commands and decides _events_ without doing any I/O. The _event sink_ commits those events, the _projections_ the UI reads, the _command receipt_, and _outbox_ effects in one transaction. The _effect worker_ then runs the effects, such as starting a provider turn or capturing a checkpoint, and feeds results back as commands. Provider CLIs run as subprocesses; per-provider _adapters_ translate their native protocols into orchestration events.

Learning sits beside the orchestrator, not inside it. The tutor calls the `learn` MCP toolkit (`apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits/learn`), which writes the thread's learning record through `LearningService`. A question's committed answer stays on the server until the learner answers. Answers return through the `learning.answer` RPC, which grades them and sends them to the tutor as the next turn. The tutor prompt lives in `apps/server/src/learning/tutorPrompt.ts`; learners can override it in Settings.

Architecture and its constraints: `docs/internals/overview.md`. Glossary: `docs/internals/glossary.md`

## Where code lives

- `apps/server` - WebSocket, orchestration, providers, learning. Effect-heavy: read [Effect services](docs/internals/effect-services.md) before adding server code, and `.repos/effect/LLMS.md` for the Effect library itself.
- `apps/web` - React/Vite UI; learning cards live in `components/learning`. `apps/desktop` wraps it.
- `packages/contracts` - Effect/Schema contracts plus small derived helpers. No heavy runtime logic.
- `packages/shared` - shared runtime utils, subpath exports, no barrel.
- `packages/client-runtime` - client state and RPC shared by the clients.
- `.repos/` - vendored read-only references. Prefer their patterns over invented ones. Never edit or import from them. Sync with `vpr sync:repos` when bumping the matching dependency. If it is missing (sparse checkout), read a file with `git show origin/main:.repos/<path>`.

## Taste

- Complexity belongs at the adapter boundary. Orchestration stays pure, UI stays dumb.
- Client mutations use `createEnvironmentRpcCommand`. Add protected methods to `CLIENT_GUARDED_RPC_SCOPES` in contracts and use the command's `permissionAtom` for UI availability. Grants are checked at execution against the destination environment; the server remains authoritative. Keep raw RPC clients inside `rpc/`, and extend the permission behavior tests when adding a protected method.
- Server features are services; transports stay thin. A `ws.ts` RPC handler, HTTP route, or MCP tool decodes input, calls one service method, and maps errors. See [Effect services](docs/internals/effect-services.md).
- `apps/web/src/components/ui` exports own their look. Pick a `variant` or `size`; do not restyle one with `className`. If none fits and the look is a generic concept, add a variant to the component; a look that belongs to one feature stays in that feature's own component, not in `components/ui`. Layout classes (width, flex, margin, position) belong on the parent. `shadcn/no-restyle` fails lint on violations. See [Web UI](docs/internals/web-ui.md).
- Reusable Effect functions use `Effect.fn("Service.operation")` with a stable span name, not a
  function wrapping `Effect.gen`. Keep `Effect.gen` for inline programs and layer construction.
  Use `Effect.fnUntraced` only when spans would be too frequent (stream chunks, per-event
  projection, tight loops) or duplicate an existing tracing boundary; explain that choice nearby.
  Named `Effect.fn` creates a span; the unnamed form does not. Preserve existing span names and
  options, and pass combinators as additional function-builder arguments.
- Inferred types over annotations. `any` is the enemy.
- Default to no comment. Write one only for a constraint, an external quirk, or an invariant the code can't show, in one line where you can and four at most. Don't restate names or signatures, narrate steps, record history, or explain the fix you just made; the PR carries that. `aprende/no-low-value-comments` enforces the length cap and the mechanical cases.
- React effects are for synchronizing with something outside React. Derive in render and act in handlers instead of syncing state, but don't hide real lifecycle work in refs or stores to dodge one. The `aprende/no-unreasoned-state-sync` lint rule reports every effect; one that stays states its reason with `// oxlint-disable-next-line aprende/no-unreasoned-state-sync -- <why>`.
- Learners notice a dropped frame, a lying spinner, and a stale label. No continuously repainting animations; they peg the GPU on high-refresh displays.
- If a rule here fights the task in front of you, say so loudly and get a human sign-off before breaking it.

## Additional tips

- Security is important, but should not be over-indexed on, especially for dev mode/maintainer-only features.
